# HBD Manager — Automated Wishes Management System

HBD Manager is a full-stack automated wishes platform that allows organizations, managers, or teams to send birthday greetings and other custom wishes without manual effort. The system intelligently schedules and delivers personalized messages to employees or users at the right time.

The goal of this project is to remove the friction of remembering important dates while maintaining a personal touch through automated communication.

---

## Overview

HBD Manager acts as a centralized reminder and message delivery system. Managers can add employee details, store important dates, and configure automated greetings. A background scheduler continuously monitors upcoming events and triggers personalized wishes automatically.

The system is built with scalability, maintainability, and real-world production architecture in mind.
